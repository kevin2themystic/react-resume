    "objective": "Ideally I would like to work in an environment where disciplined project management meets innovation and inspiration. I enjoy working on teams and collaborating with colleagues in order to reach the best solution possible to meet the requirements. I love a good mix of taking what I already know and applying it and learning new methodologies and technologies on the job. I value any opportunity to learn and expand and would like to explore a wider range of avenues within the Microsoft.Net stack as well as front end JavaScript development such as React, Angular, jQuery and other leading client-side frameworks."
