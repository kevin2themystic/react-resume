    "objective": "My objective is to bring value to your software project in the form of ease, fun, teamwork, knowledge of architecture, standards and best practices and work ethic with integrity. I don't bring my ego to projects and although I do bring and share lots of ideas; I am always looking for balance and for clues in the team and in the environment to show the way forward. I strive towards a balance between creative innovation and disciplined project management in a way that is appropriate for each project and I enjoy applying what I know on the job but also stretching myself to learn new things and I excel at learning new technologies and applying them."
